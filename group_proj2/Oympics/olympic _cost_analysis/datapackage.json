{"name":"sports_olympics","title":"Olympics","description":"The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games\n\n\"Given that Olympic Games held over the past decade each have cost USD 8.9 billion on average, the size and financial risks of the Games warrant study. The objectives of the Oxford Olympics study are to (1) establish the actual outturn costs of previous Olympic Games in a manner where cost can consistently be compared across Games; (2) establish cost overruns for previous Games, i.e., the degree to which final outturn costs reflect projected budgets at the bid stage, again in a way that allows comparison across Games; (3) test whether the Olympic Games Knowledge Management\nProgram has reduced cost risk for the Games, and, finally, (4) benchmark cost and cost overrun for the Rio 2016 Olympics against previous Games. The main contribution of the Oxford study is to establish a phenomenology of cost and cost overrun at the Olympics, which allows consistent and systematic comparison across Games. This has not been done before.\" - From the abstract of the report, _The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games_ study by Bent Flyvbjerg, Allison Stewart, and Alexander Budzier at Oxford. \n\n\n\n- Table 1: Table 1: Actual outturn sports-related costs of the Olympic Games 1960-2016, in 2015 USD\n \n![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/TScbGyI.png)\n\n- Table 2: Table 2: Cost per event and cost per athlete in the Olympics 1960-2016, million 2015 USD\n\n![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/AKz32Ob.png)\n\n\nNotes:\n- Current projected Rio 2016 figures have been used.  \n- n/a ** - Mexican Peso and Yugoslavian dinar experienced hyperinflation during or after the Games.\n\nSource: [The Oxford Olympics Study 2016:\nCost and Cost Overrun at the Games](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Press_Office/Docs/Olympics2016v4.6.pdf)","homepage":"https://data.world/sports/olympics","resources":[{"name":"cost_per_event_and_cost_per_athlete_in_the_olympics","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"games","title":"Games","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"},{"name":"year","title":"Year","type":"gyear","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYear"},{"name":"country","title":"Country","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"},{"name":"type","title":"Type","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"},{"name":"cost_per_event_mio_usd","title":"Cost per event, mio.
