Project plan : compare the top 500 album from rolling stone with billboard and look at it from a critical standpoint. 
               We want to find if there is any corelation between popularity vs critical acclaim.
               Look at them filtered by genre, decades , artists etc  
               Look for bias between older and newer digital albums.
